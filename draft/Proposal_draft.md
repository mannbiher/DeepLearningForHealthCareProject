# Project Proposal

1) Identify and motivate the problems that you want to address in your
 project.

Identification of Covid-19 disease from X-Ray of patient

2) Conduct literature search to understand the state of arts and the
gap for solving the problem.

3) Formulate the data science problem in details (e.g., classification vs.
predictive modeling vs. clustering problem).

Data:
5508 chest x-ray images
2874 independent patient cases

Very small dataset so lot of data processing is required.


It is a Classification problem

Use basis model
1. InceptionV3
2. Vgg19_bn
3. ResNeXt101
4. Resnet152
5. Densenet161

Ensemble model learning

Use Focal loss learning (FLANNEL Training algoritm)




6) Identify clearly the success metric that you would liketo use (e.g.,
AUC, accuracy, recall, speedup in running time).

1. Precision-Recall curve
2. ROC curve
3. Confusion Matrix
4. F1 score comparision accuracy of all methods

5) Setup the analytic infrastructure for your project (including both
hardware and software environment, e.g., Azure or local clusters 
with Python, PyTorch and all necessary packages).




6) Discover the key data that will be used in your project and make sure
an efficient path for obtaining the dataset. This is a crucial step and
can be quite time-consuming,so do it on the first day and never stops 
until the project completion.

7) Generate initial statistics over the raw data to make surethe data quality 
is good enough and the key assumptionabout the data are met.

8) Identify the high-level technical approaches for theproject (e.g., what 
algorithms to use or pipelines to use).

9) Prepare a timeline and milestones of deliverables for theentire project.

10) Itâ€™srequired to utilize deep learning methodssay CNN,RNN, GNN etc. in 
your project.

11) Each project team consists of up to 4 students.3-4students per teamis encouraged 
because the standard isconsistent regardless of team size.

12) No late submission allowed or grace period used for project.
